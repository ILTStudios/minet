                        Meta-Dash is an interactive hub that allows you to access the different 
                        parts of the metaverse in one place. Due to the privatization of areas 
                        in the metaverse, each having different mechanics and rules, it is 
                        difficult to access them easily. Moreover, it is hard to switch between 
                        these areas.
